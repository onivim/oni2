# Oni 2

### Lightweight, Modal Code Editor

:warning: Pre-alpha - not yet usable! :warning: 

## Introduction

Oni 2 is a reimagination of the [Oni](https://onivim.io) editor. Oni 2 aims to bring the _speed_ of Sublime, the _language integration_ of VSCode, and the _modal editing experience_ of (neo)vim together, in a single package.

Oni 2 is built in [`reason`](https://reasonml.github.io) using the [`revery`](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) framework.

## Goals

- __Modern UX__ - an experience on par with modern code editors like VSCode and Atom
- __VSCode Plugin Support__ - use all of the features of VSCode plugins, including language servers and debuggers
- __Cross-Platform__ - works on Windows, OSX, and Linux
- __Batteries Included__ - works out of the box
- __Performance__ - no compromises: native performance, minimal input latency
- __Ease Learning Curve__ - Oni 2 should be comfortable for non-vimmers, too!

The goal of this project is to build an editor that doesn't exist today - the _speed_ of a native code editor like Sublime, the _power_ of modal editing, and the _rich tooling_ that comes with a lighweight editor like VSCode.
