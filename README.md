## Introduction

Oni 2 is a reimagination of the [Oni](https://www.onivim.io) editor. Oni 2 aims to bring the _speed_ of Sublime, the _language integration_ of VSCode, and the _modal editing experience_ of (neo)vim together, in a single package.

Oni 2 is built in [`reason`](https://reasonml.github.io) using the [`revery`](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) framework.

### Goals

- __Modern UX__ - an experience on par with modern code editors like VSCode and Atom
- __VSCode Plugin Support__ - use all of the features of VSCode plugins, including language servers and debuggers
- __Cross-Platform__ - works on Windows, OSX, and Linux
- __Batteries Included__ - works out of the box
- __Performance__ - no compromises: native performance, minimal input latency
- __Easy to Learn__ - Onivim 2 should be comfortable for non-vimmers, too!

The goal of this project is to build an editor that doesn't exist today - the _speed_ of a native code editor like Sublime, the _power_ of modal editing, and the _rich tooling_ that comes with a lightweight editor like VSCode.

### Non-goals

- __VimL compatibility__ - we may not support all features of VimL plugins / configuration.

## License

Onivim 2 is currently licensed under the [CC-BY-NC-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode) license.

This means that Onivim 2 is __free to use__ for __non-commercial__ or __educational__ uses. 

> __NOTE:__ We're reviewing our license terms with a lawyer, so they may change slightly (it turns out the CC-BY-NC-4.0 isn't the perfect fit for software - we might need a more official EULA).

For __commercial use licenses__, we're still working through the details - but once Onivim 2 has reached "MVP" (target - end of May), we'll transition from crowdfunding to selling commercial licenses. Our current planned price point is $10/month.

However, until that time, __we're offering anyone who donates to the project - any dollar amount__ - an individual, perpetual-use commercial license. We don't want early adopters to have to pay again, ever, as we launch Onivim 2 - we truly appreciate the support as we transition to a commercial offering, and we know it's a leap of faith to back an early-stage project!
