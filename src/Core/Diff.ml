        are also present in [b]; this way, the main algorithm can skip items
        which, anyway, are different. This improves the speed much.
          The same time, this function updates the items of so that all
        equal items point to the same unique item. All items comparisons in
        the main algorithm can therefore be done with [==] instead of [=],
