/*
 * GlobalContext.re
 *
 * This is a workaround for the lack of Context API today in brisk-reconciler: https://github.com/briskml/brisk-reconciler/issues/16
 * The idea is, prior to rendering, we'll pull up the stuff we need across the render tree
 * (things that would be provided via `<Provider />`), and store them here.
 *
 * Hopefully, once there is a context API, this can be wholly replaced with it!
