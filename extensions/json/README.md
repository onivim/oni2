The majority of this extension is ported from the VSCode repository:
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/json-language-features

However, the tree-sitter scope resolver is ported from ATOM (and converted from cson -> json):
- https://github.com/atom/language-json/blob/master/grammars/tree-sitter-json.cson
