# Code of Conduct

All (core) team members, contributors/committers and volunteers in this project are required to act according to the following Code of Conduct. We ask you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Visual Studio Code a positive and growing project and help us provide and ensure a safe environment for everyone.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us at support@nordtheme.com or directly to one of the core team members via [email][mailmap]. Your reports will be taken seriously and not dismissed or argued with.

## What we believe in and how we act

- In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We welcome people regardless of these or other attributes.
- Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement.
- We believe that a diverse community where people treat each other with respect is stronger, more vibrant and has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas. We aim for more diversity.
- We are kind, welcoming and courteous to everyone.
- We are focusing on what is best for the community.
- We are respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments and their efforts.
- We are attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we are tactful and respectful when approaching differing views and experiences.
- We are aware that language shapes reality. Thus, we use inclusive, gender-neutral language in the documents we provide and when we talk to people. When referring to a group of people, we aim to use gender-neutral terms like “team”, “folks” or “everyone”. <sup>[1][ref-gender-neutral-docs]</sup>
- We respect that people have differences of opinion and criticize constructively.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Do not be mean or rude.
- Do not discriminate against anyone.
- Sexism and racism of any kind (including sexist and racist "jokes"), demeaning or insulting behavior and harassment are seen as direct violations to this Code of Conduct. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to age, body size, culture, ethnicity, gender expression, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal ability or disability, physical appearance, physical or mental difference, race, religion, set of skills, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
- Respect that some individuals and cultures consider the casual use of profanity offensive and off-putting.
- Derailing, tone arguments and otherwise playing on people's desires to be nice are not welcome, especially in discussions about violations to this Code of Conduct.
- Please avoid unstructured critique.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
