Time flies - can't believe it's been a month and it's time to release 0.5.3. I'm still getting used to this monthly-release-schedule, but it's nice to be able to share what's happening more frequently.

Thanks for checking out this update and for helping us make it here!

Some highlights for 0.5.3:

### CodeLens

Onivim now supports inline elements _between_ lines of code  - this is a feature that I had always wanted in Onivim v1, but never could get quite right.

It's particularly useful for working in ReasonML or OCaml, because those extensions show you the type signatures that are being inferred:

Having that live-type inference for those languages is a huge time-saver!

However, there are several other extensions that use it too. For example, the bundled JavaScript / TypeScript extensions can show reference counts:

And the C# extension does this by default:

Language extensions like [Elm](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Elmtooling/elm-ls-vscode) use it to show what functions are part of the public interface:

It's actually pretty tricky to get right - there are challenges with performance, with animating, with aligning the viewport to minimize 'jerk', and it touches
all kinds of other features like word wrap. Being in the vim-world makes it extra tricky, because depending on the size of the inline elements, the number of
visible buffer lines could vary, depending on where you are in the editor.

Some users still might find this feature distracting, though, so you can turn it off by setting `"editor.codeLens": false` in your configuration.

### Menu bar

Finally... Onivim has a menu bar on all platforms!

On OSX, we integrate with the native application bar:

It's pretty spartan at the moment, but gives us the infrastructure necessary to keep adding more commands.

Thanks to @zbaylin for all the work he did to wire up the native OSX APIs to support this!

### Preview functionality

@fanantoxa has implemented a great feature for users accustomed to VSCode - preview functionality.

Preview mode, which is on-by-default, means that the tab for an editor is re-used when clicking on it via the file explorer. 
This is great for users who explore the workspace with the mouse, as you can keep re-using the editor until you'e settled on the file you wish to work on.

Thanks @fanantoxa for the awesome contribution!

### Configurable font weight

Another finally... the font weight for Onivim is configurable!

Onivim now has an `"editor.fontWeight"` setting:

Thanks @marcagba for implementing this!

### Additional language servers

Onivim now bundles an HTML language server:

![html-language-server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13532591/106822846-b7a04a80-6634-11eb-876c-96299c0d6e03.gif)

The HTML language server supports diagnostics, codelens, completion, and an outline view.

We've also bundled a JSON language server, which features diagnostics and outline view integration.

### Extension host bug fixes

- We've upgraded the extension host (from 1.51.0, to 1.52.1) - bringing us up-to-date with the Code extension host.
- Fixed some blockers around extensions

### Vim bug fixes

- `Control+[` now behaves like `Esc` across the UI
- Conflicting `Control+b` bindings were removed
- `Control+o` behavior in insert mode is fixed
- `:tabnew`/`:new`/`:vnew` behavior is fixed
