Time flies - can't believe it's been a month and it's time to release 0.5.3. I'm still getting used to this monthly-release-schedule, but it's nice to be able to share what's happening more frequently.

Thanks for checking this out and for helping us to get here!

Some highlights:

### CodeLens Support

Onivim now supports inline elements _between_ lines of code  - this is a feature that I had always wanted in Onivim v1, but never could get right.

It's particularly useful for working in ReasonML or OCaml, because those extensions show you the type signatures that are being inferred:

However, there are several other extensions that use it too. For example, the JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# extensions can show a reference count:

TODO

Languages like Elm use it to show what functions are part of the public interface:

TODO

And there's some extension like VersionLens that us CodeLens to show:

### Menubar

Finally... Onivim has a menubar:

Thanks to @zbaylin for all the work he did to wire up the native OSX APIs to support this!

### Preview Functionality

### Configurable font weight

### Additional Language Servers

Onivim now bundles an HTML language server and JSON language server:

### Extension host

- Fixed some blockers around extensions

### Vim

- `Control+[` now behaves like `Esc` across the UI
- Conflicting `Control+b` bindings were removed
- `Control+o` behavior in insert mode is fixed

Cheers,
Bryan, Ryan & Zach
