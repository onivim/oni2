Happy New Year! I hope everyone's 2021 is off to a great start,
and you're all staying safe and healthy. Sure was a wild ride, I hope 2021 is a better year...

I want to start by thanking everyone who's helped us weather 2020 and
continue to work and progress on Onivim 2. Wouldn't be here without all
your support!

Without further ado - I'm pleased to announce our 0.5.2 release. I'll also
include some highlights from the 0.5.1 release, which was ninja-released in December and didn't get a formal announcement.

### Vim-style navigation across panes

Onivim now supports Vim-style navigation for several UI elements, including the file explorer:

The search sidebar:

And our new symbol outline view (accessible via `gO` in normal mode, when provided by a language extension):

All of these can be navigated via the <C-w>h/j/k/l bindings and support many navigation commands (gg, G, zz, zb, zt, etc).

### UI for `:!` command output

We now support displaying output via the bang `:!` ex command:

### Word-wrap support

Finally, we support word-wrap:

This can be set via the `"editor.wordWrap": true` configuration setting, or via `:set wrap`/`:set nowrap`.

### Auto-update

@zbaylin has done some heroic work to add auto-update support on Windows and OSX via the [Sparkle Framework](https://sparkle-project.org/).

So cool to have the infrastructure for this in place, and to have it integrated on Windows and OSX! 

Still working on the Linux plan - investigating some strategies like AppImageUpdate or the Snap store to provide this.
If you have experience / ideas/ preferences here - let me know.

### Keyword Completion

Previously, we only supported completion when it came from a VSCode language extension.

However, 0.5.1 added keyword completion:

### ANGLE Support

On Windows, it turns out OpenGL isn't that well supported by default... this
is especially true for VMs. DirectX tends to receive more investment in turns
of driver support than OpenGL. There were several cases where we expected OpenGl
to be available, but it just wasn't around.

We now use [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle), which is an OpenGL API
backed by DirectX - this means that we can benefit from better driver, hardware, and platform support.

### First-run experience on OSX

On OSX, the first-run experience for Onivim was painful. On starting the editor,
you'd get nagged to enable notifications. And then be prompted for permission to access your Documents - both of these are unnecessary just to start using Onivim. 

We've smoothed some of these rough edges out, and before, we'd auto-open the Documents folder (resulting in that nag dialog).

Now, we don't open a folder by default:

### VSCode Extension Host Fixes

Ongoing, across these monthly releases, I continue to fix bugs and broaden our support
for VSCode plugins.

Some notable improvements around the extension host:

- [#2332](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2332): Add XML extension
- [#2422](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2422): Upgrade vscode-exthost -> 1.46.0
- [#2423](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2423): Upgrade vscode-exthost -> 1.47.1
- [#2509](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2509): Fix blockers for vscode-spell-checker
- [#2683](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2683): Upgrade vscode-exthost -> 1.50.1
- [#2684](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2684), [#2728](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2728), [#2786](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2786), [#2809](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2809): Fix various errors around searching / downloading extensions
- [#2760](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2760): Fix crash on completion details error
- [#2712](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2712): Add support for additionalTextEdits (auto-import) for completion provider

### Vim fixes

Of particular note on the Vim-side, I've been starting to do work to unblock
Vim extensions. These expose some bugs in `libvim` that I've been addressing:

I'm closer to getting a plugin like vim-surround working:

(Note that the keydisplayer doesn't pick up `getchar()` right now - the key sequence I pressed is `cs(}`)

Some of the basic gestures work - like 'cs', 'ds' - but undo is not correct, and there are still blockers for some of the gestures - still working through those.

Other notable fixes:

- [#2351](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2351): Fix crash on `:enew`
- [#2373](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2373): Macro indicator in status bar
- [#2364](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2364): Show pending operator in status bar
- [#2429](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2429): Fix visual-in motion (viw/vi") commands
- [#2574](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2574): Flakiness in cursor positioning after leaving insert mode
- [#2699](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2699): Implement `getchar()` handler (needed for VimL plugin support)
- [#2765](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2765): Hook up `messages` and `messages clear` ex commands
- [#2792](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pull/2792): Handle count for insert mode commands

This is just a snapshot of the changes in 0.5.2 and 0.5.1. The full
changelogs are available here:

- [0.5.1 Changelog](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/blob/66f31792d6f650f044a8d22861c82f78ff142b52/CHANGES_CURRENT.md)
- [0.5.2 Changelog](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/blob/5c77004c930bfd4233418f1b7d8235447e1d7f12/CHANGES_CURRENT.md)

One resolution I have for 2021 is more frequent updates - I've had
to push deadlines back a few times and have longer gaps between updates -
the downside with that is, often, there are smaller changes that would
be nice to showcase... but fall through the cracks. I'd like to highlight monthly progress.

I'm still working towards the 0.6.0 release - there's still a lot of work left - so these incoming, monthly `0.5.x` releases will be focusing on getting us there.

The 0.6.0 release was originally planned for end of December - so unfortunately I will push it out,
as there is still work left to accomplish these renaming goals:
- VimL plugin integration
- Snippet support
- Vim code folding integration
- Code lens
- Code actions

I'm going to switch the deadline to "When It's Done" - what I found in 2020
was that I'd push aggressive deadlines for myself. I believe these deadline / estimates would be in valid
in a vaccuum, ie, if I was 100% focused on coding - but unfortunately that's just never the reality.

There's a lot of things that come up in the course
of the milestone, perhaps crash reports or daily editor blockers, which I want to address right away, but
are unplanned, or opportunistic fixes that get opened up due to contributions or new architecture -
the menubar work in 0.5.3 is an example of this. 

The other challenge is juggling a variety of priorities that come up:
- Milestone goals
- Daily editor blockers / crashes
- Top upvoted issues
- Vim workstream
- VSCode extension host workstream

So once we get to 0.6.0, subsequent milestones will be determined by the highest upvoted issues. This will help
to consolidate and stay focused on the right set of priorities for users. And you can help me prioritize by upvoting
ones that are relevant to you!

Lastly, I've been A/B testing the website - experimenting with Patreon vs the pre-order-lifetime-license. If any patrons would prefer a lifetime license as opposed to a monthly, just send me a message and I'll make sure you get credited the difference.

In the meantine - I'll be continuing to work towards the 0.6.0 release on the timeline -
the monthly releases will be `0.5.x` until we've accomplished the goals for that.

Ultimately, I want to get these features in & get to the point of having a trial build. Onwards :)

Thanks for reading, and for helping us to keep pushing on achieving this goal of "Modal Editing from the Future"! Your help, feedback, and support has been instrumental in helping us to progress and push forward.

Cheers,
Bryan, Ryan & Zach
