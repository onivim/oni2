## Learning Vim

- [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition) is a great book on Vim, and mostly applicable to Onivim.
- [Seven habits of effective text editing](https://moolenaar.net/habits.html) by Bram Moolenaar (the creator of Vim) is a great resource, and again, mostly applicable to Onivim.
