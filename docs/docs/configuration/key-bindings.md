Onivim's keyboard configuration is designed to be mostly compatible with [VSCode's Key Bindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

## Editing the keybindings

- Press `Command+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Control+Shift+P` (Windows, Linux) to bring up the command palette
- Select `Preferences: Open keybindings File`

### Keybinding Format

Keybindings are defined as a JSON array, like:
```
[
  { "key": "<C-P>", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen", "when": "editorTextFocus" }
]
```

Each rule consists of:
- A `key` that describes the pressed keys

> __NOTE:__ Today, our key format is expressed as a Vim-style key-binding. Our plan, though, is to support both Vim-style (`<C-K>`) and VSCode-style key specifies (`ctrl+k`)

- A `command` containing the identifier of the command to execute
- An __optional__ `when` clause containing a boolean expression that will be evaluated depending on the current editor state.

When a key is pressed:
- The rules are evaluated from __bottom__ to __top__
- The first rule that matches, both the `key` and in terms of `when` is accepted
- If a rule is found and has a `command` set, the `command` is executed.
- If no matching rules are found, we pass the input key through to `libvim` to be handled by Vim.

There are a set of default rules provided by Onivim, but the customized rules are appended to the bottom - thus, user key bindings are executed first.

### `key` format

The `key` parameter supports both _Vim style_ and _VSCode style_ key bindings.

#### Vim style

Vim-style keybindings are surrounded by `<` and `>`, and allow the following modifiers:

| Modifier | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C-` | Control key | `<C-P>` |
| `S-` | Shift key | `<S-P>` |
| `A-` | Alt key | `<A-P>` |
| `D-` | Command key | `<D-P>` | 

> __Note:__ A difference between Vim and Onivim is that `D-` also handles the 'Meta' and 'Win' keys on Linux and Windows, respectively

Modifiers may be combined, for example:

```
[
  { "key": "<C-S-P>", "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen", "when": "editorTextFocus" }
]
```

The `<C-S-P>` key binding would require the Control, Shift, and P keys to be pressed.

#### VSCode style

VSCode-style keybindings feature friendly names, like:

| Modifier | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+` | Control key | `Ctrl+P` |
| `Shift+` | Shift key | `Shift+P` |
| `Alt+` | Alt key | `Alt+J` |
| `Meta+` | Meta/Command/Windows key |
| `Cmd+` | Same as above | `Cmd+P` |
| `Win+` | Same as above | `Win+P` |

### Key Sequences

Onivim supports binding to key sequences, which require multiple key-presses in succession to engage.

Example:

```
  { "key": "jk", "command": "vim.esc", "when": "insertMode" }
```

This would require a key-press of 'j', followed by 'k'.


### `command` arguments

### `when` clause contexts

Onivim 2 gives you control over when key bindings are enabled through the `when` clause. 

#### Conditional operators

For conditional expressions, you can use the following conditional operators:

| Operator | Symbol | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Or | <code>&#124;&#124;</code> | <code>menuFocus &#124;&#124; textInputFocus</code> |
| And | `&&` | `insertMode && suggestWidgetVisible` |

Expressions may be grouped with `()`, for example:
```
(menuFocus && !insertMode) || suggestWidgetVisible
```

#### Contexts

Common contexts with VSCode:

| Context Name | True When | 
| --- | --- |
| `editorTextFocus` | An editor has focus |
| `textInputFocus` | A text input area has focus |
| `terminalFocus` | A terminal has focus |
| `suggestWidgetVisible` | The suggest widget (auto-completion) is visible |

Onivim-specific contexts:

| Context Name | True When | 
| --- | --- |
| `insertMode` |  The active editor is in `insert` mode |
| `normalMode` |  The active editor is in `normal` mode |
| `visualMode` |  The active editor is in `visual` mode |
| `sneakMode` | Sneak mode is active |
| `commandLineFocus` | The Vim commandline is open |
| `menuFocus` | A pop-up menu has focus |
