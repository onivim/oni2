Visual Mode can be thought of like 'selection' in other non-modal code editors - it shows a visual representation of a motion,
and any operator is applied to the 'selected' text.

There are three variations of visual mode, and they can be entered from normal mode:

- Line mode: <kbd>V</kbd>
- Character mode: <kbd>v</kbd>
- Block mode: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>v</kbd> (although when this key chord is in use to paste, an alternative is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>q</kbd>)

When in visual mode, pressing a [motion] key - like <kbd>h</kbd>, <kdb>w</kbd>, etc - will extend the visual range.

Visual mode is a great to learn Vim motions, because you get immediate visual feedback!
