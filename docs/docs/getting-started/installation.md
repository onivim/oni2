While we're developing Onivim 2, the latest builds are available at our [early access portal](https://v2.onivim.io/early-access-portal).

## OSX (10.13+)

1. Download `Onivim2` for macOS.
2. Double-click on the downloaded archive to expand the contents.
3. Drag `Onivim2.App` to the `Applications` Folder, which will make it available in `Launchpad`.
4. _OPTIONAL:_ Add Onivim2 to your Dock by right-clicking on the icon to bring up the context menu, and choosing __Options, Keep in Dock.__

## Windows (x64)

1. Download the Onivim 2 Installer for Windows.
2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (Onivim2.exe).

> __NOTE:__ Even though the app is code-signed, SmartScreen may show up as the app builds up 'reputation'. Microsoft establishes the reputation of an executable based on the number of installations; so we need to build up some 'reputation'. 
>
> Validate that the publisher is listed as "Outrun Labs, LLC" and you can proceed with the installation.

3. By default, the setup program installs Onivim 2 in `C:\Program Files\Onivim2\Oni2.exe`.

## Linux (x64)

1. Download `Onivim2.AppImage`.
2. `$ chmod u+x Onivim2.AppImage`.
3. `$ ./Onivim2.AppImage`.
