# Why Onivim?

A fair question to ask is - why yet _another_ text editor? Aren't Vim, VSCode, Atom, or Sublime good enough?

We appreciate aspects of each of these editors, as we've taken pieces and inspiration from each of the above - but our goal is to build an editor with the following principles at the forefront:

## Core Principles

Onivim 2 is our ideal code editor - in our vision, the fastest way to go from thought to code. 

### Performant

We built Onivim 2 from the ground up to be performant. Our ideal code editor starts up instantly, is extremely responsive, and never makes us wait.

The current trend of code editors is to build them on a web technology stack - which, in our mind, compromises the user experience.

### Modal

Our ideal code editor is modal - allowing you to be __maximally productive__ using __just the keyboard__. There is a learning curve to modal editing, to be sure, but once you've learned it,
it's tough to go back!

### Modern

Onivim 2 should be aesthetically pleasing, look and feel modern, and be beautiful to use.

### Out-of-box productivity

Onivim 2 should be productive and useful out-of-the-box, without needing to spend lots of time configuring to get basics like code completion or snippets working.

## Beautiful, Fast, Modern Modal Editing

Editors like VSCode and Atom are modern, extensible, and out-of-the-box productive, but are built on a technology stack that compromises the user experience.

Vim is an amazing modal editor, but it lacks a modern UI, and requires significant configuration and investment to come even close to the language support of Atom or VSCode.

Sublime shows that you can have a modern, beautiful UI without sacrificing performance - but limited extensibility and modal editing capability.

Each of these editors embodies some of the core principles we value, but none embody them all - and that's why we're building Onivim: a beautiful, fast, and modern modal editor.
