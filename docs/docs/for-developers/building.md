# Building the Editor

## Prerequisites

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install [Esy](https://esy.sh) (__0.6.10__ or above is required, but the latest version is recommended: `npm install -g esy@latest`)
> __NOTE:__ **Linux-only**: if you need to install using `sudo npm install -g esy@latest` then your NPM installation **might be broken** follow [the instruction here to fix it](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) this is related to this issue [esy/esy#1099.](https://github.com/esy/esy/issues/1099)

- __Windows-only__: Run `npm install -g windows-build-tools` (this installs some build tools that aren't included by default on Windows)
- Install any other system packages required by Oni2 dependencies, as outlined below.

## Dependencies

All platforms require `git`, `node` and `esy`, and the ones outlined in the `revery` docs:
https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/wiki/Building-&-Installing.

### Windows

No additional requirements.

### macOS

Requires `libtool` and `gettext` from homebrew: `brew install libtool gettext`.

### Linux

Some Linux distributions may need other packages:

 - Ubuntu : `nasm`,`libacl1-dev`, `libncurses-dev` latter two for `libvim`.
 - Fedora/CentOS : `libXt-devel`, `libSM-devel`, `libICE-devel`, `libacl-devel` and `ncurses-devel ` for `libvim`
 - Xorg related libraries: `libglu1-mesa-dev`, `libxxf86vm-dev` and `libxkbfile-dev`.


## Build and Run

### Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/onivim/oni2
cd oni2
```

### Install node dependencies

```sh
npm install -g node-gyp
node install-node-deps.js
```

> __NOTE:__ The non-standard `node install-node-deps.js` step instead of `npm install` is necessary because the script picks up our _vendored_ node binary.

> __NOTE:__ The `node install-node-deps.js` command will need to be re-run whenever the extension host is upgraded.

### Build the front-end

> __NOTE:__ On Windows, you must __build from a shell running as administrator__. This is a requirement of esy because creating symlinks requires administrator permissions. More info at [esy/esy#389](https://github.com/esy/esy/issues/389).

> __NOTE:__ On macOS, if you receive an `error: Too many open files`, you can run `ulimit -Sn 4096` to increase the file limit. More info at [esy/esy#1057](https://github.com/esy/esy/issues/1057)

```sh
# Install dependencies in package.json
esy install

# Builds most dependencies and run Oni2 specific bootstrapping.
# Takes upwards of 30 mins on a normal machine.
# esy does intelligently cache to ~/.esy, subsequent builds are fast.
esy bootstrap

# Finish up remaining parts of building. Should be quick.
esy build
```

### Run health-check

> The `--checkhealth` argument validates all dependencies are available and working.

- `esy run -f --checkhealth`


### Run Onivim 2

- `esy run`

### Tests

- `esy '@test' install`
- `esy '@test' build`
- `esy '@test' run`

### Inline Unit Tests

- `esy '@test' inline`

### Check build

- `esy build dune build @check`

### Benchmarks

- `esy '@bench' install`
- `esy '@bench' build`
- `esy '@bench' run`

### Format code

We use auto formatting tool, you might want to run it before you commit changes

- `esy format`

## Release

> __NOTE:__ On macOS, checkhealth may report that a library is not loaded (e.g. Sparkle). This is normal. To check that libraries are loaded in a generated release build, see the section on macOS below.

To create a release build, run:

- `esy '@release' run -f --checkhealth`
- `esy '@release' install`
- `esy '@release' run --help`
- `esy '@release' create`

This will create a `_esy/release` folder at the root with the application bundle inside that folder there will be folders for built binaries, in `_esy/release/install/bin` the `Oni2` binary resides along `Oni2_editor`.

With the exception of macOS, these are actually symbolic links to `oni2/_esy/release/store/b/oni2-<hashvalue>/install/default/bin/Oni2`, the same is true for the `Oni2_editor` binary. On macOS, the symlinks are replaced with the actual binaries.

### Windows

To create an installation package for Windows, run the following PowerShell script:

- `./scripts/windows/publish.ps1`

### macOS

When building a release on newer versions of macOS, checkhealth will report that some libraries are not loaded. This is because the libraries are not accessible until the app is fully built and can be ignored.

To check that the libraries are in fact included in a generated release build, you can run the following command from the `oni2` directory:

- `./_release/Onivim2.app/Contents/MacOS/Oni2 -f --checkhealth`

You can also install Oni2 in your `Applications` folder.

Run the following from the `oni2` directory:

- `cp -R _release/Onivim2.app /Applications`

If you want to open the editor from the terminal with an `oni2` command, you can add Oni2 to the system PATH using a command
from within the app:

- Open Oni2 from launchpad
- Open command palette with `Cmd + Shift + P`
- Execute: `System: Add Oni2 to System PATH`

## Extension Integration

If you want to develop, or debug, an extension integration, the following tips may help:

### Testing with oni-dev-extenion

There is a development extension in `src/development_extensions/oni-dev-extension` which can be used to implement dummy functionality that is often easier to test and integrate with than real extensions.

#### Resources
- [VS Code API reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api)

### Instrumenting extensions

To add logging, use `console.error` - messages on `stderr` will be shown in Onivim's log. (Make sure to turn debug logging on, via `ONI2_DEBUG=1` environment variable or the `--debug` command-line arg).

Both the oni-dev-extension and any other extension can be instrumented, as they're usually included in non-minified form.

### Extension host

If there's a problem in-between Oni2 and the extension, it can be helpful to build and instrument your own copy of the extension host.

#### Building

- Navigate to your home directory (ie, `cd ~` on Linux / macOS, or `cd /` on Windows)
- `git clone https://github.com/onivim/vscode-exthost`
- `cd vscode-exthost`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn compile`

You can use the `yarn watch` command too - this is useful for iterating quickly!

#### Testing

You can use the `ONI2_EXTHOST` environment variable to override the default extension host with your local extension host:
- `ONI2_EXTHOST=/Users/<your-username>/vscode-exthost esy run -f --debug``

For example, adding the logging here (the [`$executeContributedCommand`](https://github.com/onivim/vscode-exthost/blob/a25f426a04fe427beab7465be660f89a794605b5/src/vs/workbench/api/node/extHostCommands.ts#L165) proxy method)

Results in this debug logging:

#### Protocol

The extension host protocol is defined in [extHost.protocol.ts](https://github.com/onivim/vscode-exthost/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/node/extHost.protocol.ts). Interfaces prefixed with `MainThread` refer to messages sent from the extension host to the "main thread", which in our case is Oni2. While interfaces prefixed with `ExtHost` refer to messages sent _to_ the extension host.

# Building the Documentation Website

From the `oni2` directory:

- `cd docs/website`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
