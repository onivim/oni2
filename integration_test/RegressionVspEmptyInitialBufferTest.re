// Regression test for #594:
// When running ':vsp' on an initial buffer, we shouldn't get a new buffer

// This is sort of an indirect way to test #594, but one of the contributing
// factors to the crash is that we were deciding to open a new / invalid
// buffer - so by testing that we aren't opening a new buffer at all,
// we can avoid that particular issue.
